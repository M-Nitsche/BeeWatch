Augmentation:
- Without resize and pad augmentation
- No brightness augmentation as synthetic data is already augmenting brightness & contrast
- Only Horizontal Flip so far
Image resizer:
- fixed_shape_resizer (to 640x640x3)
- EfficientDet d1 only supports 3 channels (no grayscaling)
- Training for 30.000 steps, batch size 4 (i.e. 120 epochs)

Learning rate:
- WarmUp for initial 2500 steps (from 0.001 to 0.08) to not damage already learned lower level features
- LR-Decay towards zero over 30.000 steps (as long as training is defined)
