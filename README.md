# BeeWatch

## Motivation

Insects such as bees, wasps, flies and beetles are the most important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. From the 109 most important crops such as apples, strawberries, almonds, tomatos and melons,  about 80 % completely depend on the pollination of animals. [1] The total economic value generated by that is estimated to be around 153 billion euros per year worldwide. [2] Thinking of bees, wild bees are often underestimated in their importance when it comes to pollination. While the honeybee is ony responsible for at most one third of the pollination services, the remaining two third is done by wild bees and other wild pollinators such as the bumblebee. [3]

## Dataset

For the data collection different devices were used - a summary can be found in the table below.

| Device        | Camera/Resolution  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Iphone 7      | 12 MP         |  
| x             | ....          |
| x             | ...           |


### Labeling
For the initial labeling the [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via-1.0.6.html) was used. With it's limited export functionalty we quickly ran into problems because we experimented with different models and frameworks which required different formats. This lead us to the holostic object detection platform [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) which offers several export formats. 

The final Dataset consists of 1.814 images with 104 null examples. Each image has 1.1 annotations on average with results in 2.047 annotation overall with one class [bee]. Images are annotated with bounding boxes.

**Dataset**

| Image source  | count         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [Malika Nisal Ratnayake et. al.](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Honeybee_video_tracking_data/12895433)| 436       |  
| own images    | 1398           

Images where eather taken as a single photo, or a video was taken and then deconstructed into single frames. To turn videos into single frames [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) was used. 
Images with various different backgrounds (flowers) are included - and selection of sample images can be seen below.
