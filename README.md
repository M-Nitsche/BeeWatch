# BeeWatch

## Motivation
(Christin Scheib)  
Insects such as bees, wasps, flies and beetles are the most important pollinators of wild and cultivated plants. From the 109 most important crops such as apples, strawberries, almonds, tomatos and melons,  about 80 % completely depend on the pollination of animals. [1] The total economic value generated by that is estimated to be around 153 billion euros per year worldwide. [2] Thinking of bees, wild bees are often underestimated in their importance when it comes to pollination. While the honey bee is ony responsible for at most one third of the pollination services, the remaining two third is done by wild bees and other wild pollinators such as the bumblebee. [3] However, entomologists worldwide have been oberserving a severe decline in the population of pollinating animals. Mostly affected by this are honey bees as well as wild bees. [4] As the global agriculture sector depends on the pollination of insects the global decline is a severe threat for our ecosystem and the industries. [5] In order to counteract on this trend it is imperative to understand the root causes. Several contibution factors such as harmful pesticides, parasites, diseases, malnutrition, intruders, urbanisation and intensive monoculture cultivation have been found to lead to this global decline. [6, 7, 8, 9, 10] As these are only an subset of all the contributing factors it is hard to understand what caused a local rise in the bee mortality. 






## Dataset

For the data collection different devices were used - a summary can be found in the table below.

| Device        | Camera/Resolution  |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| IPhone 7      | 12 MP         |  
| IPhone 11 Pro | 12 MP         |
| x             | ...           |


### Labeling
For the initial labeling the [VGG Image Annotator](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/software/via/via-1.0.6.html) was used. With it's limited export functionalty we quickly ran into problems because we experimented with different models and frameworks which required different formats. This lead us to the holostic object detection platform [Roboflow](https://roboflow.com) which offers several export formats. 

The final Dataset consists of 1.814 images with 104 null examples. Each image has 1.1 annotations on average with results in 2.047 annotation overall with one class [bee]. Images are annotated with bounding boxes.

### Dataset

| Image source  | count         |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| [Malika Nisal Ratnayake et. al.](https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/dataset/Honeybee_video_tracking_data/12895433)| 436       |  
| own images    | 1398           

Images where eather taken as a single photo, or a video was taken and then deconstructed into single frames. To turn videos into single frames [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org) was used. 
Images with various different backgrounds (flowers) are included - and selection of sample images can be seen below.

### Mosaic dataset
The collected image footage is quite limited regarding the diversitiy of different flower types and colors. As the performance of computer vision applications primarly depend on the quality and especially the diversity of the training dataset, we decided to complement the collected data by a more comprehensive and diverse set of images. Therefore we picked the public image and video hosting platform [flickr](https://www.flickr.com) to do a structured search string query. Flickr is due to the extensive supply of word-tagged images from various domains a common and well-known tool for the creation of computer vision datasets. In order for us to comply with data privacy and protection guidelines, we only queried images listed under creative common licence. 
As the quality of the queried images heavily depend on the search string, we evaluated various keywords in advance. The search strings were iteratively evluated by a brief review of the responses and resulted in the following final search string: "bee flowers", "flowers" and "flower bushes". The latter were used for the [synthetic dataset generation](####Synthetic-dataset-generation) as background images.


After labeling bees in the downloaded datasets following the procedure presented in the [labeling section](###labeling) we used them to generate mosaic data. The mosaic augmentation is originally motivated in the YOLOv4 release and contributes significantly to its performance boost ([Bochkovskiy et al., 2020](literature/Bochkovskiy%20et%20al.%20(2020)%20-%20YOLOv4:%20Optimal%20Speed%20and%20Accuracy%20of%20Object%20Detection.pdf)). In order to scale down the queried bee images and benefit from the stated performance increase in model implementations beside YOLOv4/5 we generated 1000 mosaic images 3x4 and the corresponding new annotation files (see [mosaic_data_augmentation.ipynb](dataset/mosaic_data_augmentation.ipynb)). The probability of a bee image to be chosen for a individual mosaic tile was set to 0.3. The following shows an example mosaic image:

### Synthetic dataset generation


## Model

## Deployment
The Jetson Nano is a small powerful device optimized for IoT applications. It comes  with a Quad-core ARM Cortex-A57 MPCore processor, NVIDIA Maxwell architecture with 128 NVIDIA CUDA cores and 4GB RAM. The Jetson Nano does not come with the Linux architecture already setup, instead it is the first step to write the Image file to the SD Card to boot and setup the system. 

### Deployment processes
Having setup the Jetson Nano it was not yet ready for directly detecting bees as we have not deployed the model. For our case three possible deployment options were:(1) docker containers, (2) virtual environments, (3) traditional deployment.  
(1) Docker: Docker has several advantages and has become quite popular in the last couple of years.  Maintaining multple applications is a quite complex process. They are written in different languages, they use different frameworks and architectures which makes them difficult to update and to move around. Docker simplifies that by using containers. A container bundles application code with related configuration files, libraries and dependencies. By doing that it can run uniformly and consistently on any infrastructure. Furthermore, it gives developers the freedom to innovate with their choice of tools, application stacks, and deployment environments for each project. Another big advantage of docker containers is that they are portable, so that software can be built locally and then deployed and ran everywhere. Having great benefits also Docker has its downsides.
